<h1>The Pomodoro Task Manager App</h1>
Nowadays we are surrounded by distractions like OTT and video streaming platforms, social media etc that we are not able to focus and work on our tasks. The human attention span has decreased significantly owing largely to these factors. People find it hard to stay away from checking notifications even for 5 minutes.
This application is specifically designed for students and working professionals to help them plan their day and complete their tasks. 

Our app provides a simple and effective way to lead a productive day. It helps to 
organise the day and our simple interface along with location updates will make one
more structured and productive. A to-do list helps you set priorities. Making a to-do list is an important first step but prioritising that list ensures that you focus on the most 
important items. And using pomodoro technique on each of these tasks will ensure 
more focused worktime. Rewarding the user for a completed task is just as important. 
Making the completed task memorable by recording the details of its completion will 
provide the users with an increased sense of satisfaction
